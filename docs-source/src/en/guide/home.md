# Introduce

> Create more useful tool extensions for Android.

## Background

As Android system features becomes more and more abundant, there is more and more features to learn for native Android development, and there are
countless tool dependencies for the Android platform, but various problems also arise in endlessly.

The reason for initially creating this project was some problems I encountered during the Android development process, and the system's API calling
method was too cumbersome, so this project is based on the theory of "not reinventing the wheel".

From the UI to the system level, it allows developers to expand functions based on the system's original API, and solves some "black box problems"
encountered in the Android development process and for third parties.

The optimization of ROM and the "Android system" customized by third-party manufacturers, as well as the optimization of the Kotlin development
language, enable this set of tools to be non-intrusive and provide developers with a more friendly and convenient development experience under the
original ecological environment.

The emergence of this project also benefited from some of my early Android projects, a large number of functions were decoupled from
the [PureReader](https://github.com/PureReader) project.

## Usage

`BetterAndroid` is born for more modern Android development, and its original meaning is itself.

We hope that this library can successfully help developers speed up development,
improve development quality and experience, and quickly improve the functions required by apps.

## Language Requirement

It is recommended to use Kotlin as the preferred development language.

This project is entirely written in Kotlin and is compatible with Java in some parts, but it may not be fully compatible.

All demo & sample codes in the document will be described using Kotlin, if you donâ€™t know how to use Kotlin at all, you may not get the best experience.

## Contribution

The maintenance of this project is inseparable from the support and contributions of all developers.

This project is currently in its early stages, and there may still be some problems or lack of functions you need.

If possible, feel free to submit a PR to contribute features you think are needed to this project or goto [GitHub Issues](repo://issues)
to make suggestions to us.
