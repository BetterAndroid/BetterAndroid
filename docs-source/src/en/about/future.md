# Looking for Future

> The future is bright and uncertain, let us look forward to the future development space of `BetterAndroid`.

## Future Plans

> Features that `BetterAndroid` may add later are included here.

### Project Templates Visualization Creation Tool

Because the template creation projects provided by Android Studio are too redundant, we may launch a project template creation tool that integrates `BetterAndroid` related dependencies in the future. 

Currently, only [Project Template](../guide/quick-start.md#project-template) has been completed, it may exist as a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.

This feature will support the creation of native Android projects and Jetpack Compose Multiplatform projects.

### Improve compose-multiplatform

Currently [compose-multiplatform](../library/compose-multiplatform.md) is still under development and testing, and the current plan is to continue the development of this module.

We welcome more developers to participate in the development, if possible, you are welcome to submit a PR to contribute to this project or make suggestions to us through [GitHub Issues](repo://issues).
