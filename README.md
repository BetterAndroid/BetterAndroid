## Project Reason

As Android system features becomes more and more abundant, there is more and more features to learn for native Android development, and there are
countless tool dependencies for the Android platform, but various problems also arise in endlessly.

The reason for initially creating this project was some problems I encountered during the Android development process, and the system's API calling
method was too cumbersome, so this project is based on the theory of "not reinventing the wheel".

From the UI to the system level, it allows developers to expand functions based on the system's original API, and solves some "black box problems"
encountered in the Android development process and for third parties.

The optimization of ROM and the "Android system" customized by third-party manufacturers, as well as the optimization of the Kotlin development
language, enable this set of tools to be non-intrusive and provide developers with a more friendly and convenient development experience under the
original ecological environment.

The emergence of this project also benefited from some of my early Android projects, a large number of functions were decoupled from
the [PureReader](https://github.com/PureReader) project.
